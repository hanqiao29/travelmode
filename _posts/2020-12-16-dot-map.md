## Introduction
In this section, we map each trip to its state and color by mode choice. As the dot map shown, a large number of the trips are made in California, Texas, Georgia, Michigan, New York, the dots are more dense in these states. Private car(dots in yellow) is the primary travel mode choice for the majority. In states that have more large cities and metropolitan areas, such as California, New York, there are more trips made by public transit(dots in red). Additionally, trip mode choices are diverse in these states, more trips made by bikingand while private car driving is found to be the most frequently used mode. Moreover, most of trips made by long-distance transit(dots in purple) are found in California, New York, because many of the US busiest airports with high passenger traffic are in the states. For the Midwest, most of the trips are made by private car driving, few trips are made by public transit in urban area of the states.
