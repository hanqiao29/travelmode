## Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to our blog post. In this project, we have two major focus: 
1) Understand travel mode choice in the U.S. through using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey and vairous
data visualziation tools.
2) Explore different machine learning methods to predict travel mode choice using socio-economic characteristics,
trip characteristics and land-use characteristics.
As urban planners, we believe data science should be incorperated more into the planning process to help convey stories through
data visualization and to better understand people's traveling behaviors. If you are interested in the intersection of data and 
planning, please come along with us on this exciting journey! If you have questions or feedbacks, please feel free to email us at:
