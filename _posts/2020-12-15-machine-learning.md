## Introduction
Mobility is closely related with the environment and everyone's life { it impacts our accessibility to food, job
opportunities, education and recreational resources etc. In addition, transportation infrastructures shape
urban forms of a city and ways people live in that city. Understanding and predicting how people travel and
what modes of transportation they use is an essential part of urban planning. This project looks into the 2017 US
National Household Travel Survey data to predict travel mode choices of trips using various social-economic
factors, trip factors and land use factors through adopting four machine learning methods: logistic regression,
random forest, bagging, boosting.
